The performance of the two visual data is expressed by a line graph.The humidity map contains the humidity and the time stamp corresponding to each humidity value. At the same time, the temperature map contains the time stamp corresponding to the temperature and each temperature value.Humidity map: Visualization library matplotlibTemperature graph: Visualization Gallery pygalReason for selection:Matplotlib is one of Python's most powerful visual libraries. It is also the most widely used library in Python. Whether it's basic view drawing or advanced 3D view, it can be quickly rendered with simple code. And the function is easy to understand and easy to use. The generated chart can be saved directly as an image.The disadvantage of matplotlib is that the interface of the view may be less beautiful than other libraries, but it is enough for the data view.Pygal is a python third-party library for generating images in SVG format. It has very cool drawing functions, functions are equally easy to understand, and a powerful support library is handy for complex drawing work. A large number of view types are available, such as simple line graphs, horizontal line graphs, overlay graphs, time series graphs, and world maps.Disadvantages pygal generates a svg format image, can not be directly opened, you need to browse through the browser, it is more difficult to convert through the third-party svg transfer image library.
